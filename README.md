## Excalibur First Game

first excalibur game, based on hte typescript template from https://github.com/excaliburjs/example-ts-webpack

This example uses Webpack and ts-loader module to compile the TypeScript.

Before you start, install the package via your beloved dependency manager through npm install or yarn install.

To start debugging your code, run start for the development script. It would compile Excalibur and a whole thing from the /src folder into the output bundle.js file. You will be able to see a result on localhost:8080 and change your code "on the fly" without recompiling the bundle.

When you are ready to go, compile a production version with build script or choose the appropriate task from VSCode, then check out the /dist folder.

Please note: when running npm start or yarn start, the webpack-dev-server generates your files virtually so you won't find them in your /dist folder.
